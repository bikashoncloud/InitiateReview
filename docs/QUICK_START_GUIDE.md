## 🚧 WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

### Developer Says: "This is taking longer than expected"
**Your Response:**
1. How much longer? (Get specific estimate)
2. What's blocking you? (Identify issue)
3. Can we simplify? (Cut scope if needed)
4. Can the other dev help? (Pair programming)

### Developer Says: "We need to change the architecture"
**Your Response:**
1. Why? What problem does it solve?
2. Can we work around it?
3. How much time will it take?
4. Can it wait until after launch?
**Usually answer is: NO, ship with current approach**

### Developer Says: "This API is too complex"
**Your Response:**
1. What specifically is complex?
2. Can we simplify the feature?
3. Is there a library/package that helps?
4. Can we mock it for MVP?

### You Notice: No Progress for 2 Days
**Your Action:**
1. Immediate 1-on-1 meeting
2. Identify real blocker
3. Clear the blocker TODAY
4. Adjust timeline if absolutely necessary

### You Notice: Developer is burned out
**Your Action:**
1. Give a day off (yes, even in tight timeline)
2. Adjust workload
